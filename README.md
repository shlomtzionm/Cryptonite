handleCards - are you on a react project?

- if (Array.isArray(data)) {  
    return data.length === 0;
  } else { 
    return Object.keys(data).length === 0;
  }

the data type not suppose to change, its either an array or an object.

- All of this needs to be a function
let card = createElement("div", "myCard", cardContainer) as HTMLElement;
    let toggle = createToggle(card);
    let cardTitle = createElement("h5", "MY-card-title", card) as HTMLElement;
    let cardText = createElement("p", "MY-card-text", card) as HTMLElement;
    let button = createElement("button", "btn", card) as HTMLButtonElement;
    button.setAttribute("isFalse", "false");
    toggle.id = "myBtn";

 if (toggles[key] === true) {
 can be 
  if (toggles[key]) {


if (checkedToggles === 0 ||checkedToggles === undefined){
    return true
  } return false


  can be just 

  return checkedToggles === 0 ||checkedToggles === undefined


when there is an error from the server )like when i try to get more info from lots of coins, you need to tell the user that there is an error and not just an empty state
